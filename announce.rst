What is stevedore?
==================

Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure
and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions
("*plugins*") at runtime. Many applications implement their own
library for doing this, using ``__import__`` or
``importlib``. stevedore_ avoids creating yet another extension
mechanism by building on top of `setuptools entry points`_. The code
for managing entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore
provides manager classes for implementing common patterns for using
dynamically loaded extensions.

What's New?
===========

- Add memoization to the entrypoint scanning code in
  ``ExtensionManager`` to avoid performance issues in situations where
  lots of managers are instantiated with the same namespace argument.

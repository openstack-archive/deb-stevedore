Package: python-stevedore

Description: manage dynamic plugins for Python applications - python2
 Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and
 extend your application by discovering and loading extensions (plugins) at
 runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this, using
 __import__ or importlib. stevedore avoids creating yet another extension
 mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry points. The code for managing
 entry points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager
 classes for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded
 extensions.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.

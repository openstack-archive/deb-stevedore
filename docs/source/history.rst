0.6

  - Change the :class:`~stevedore.enabled.EnabledExtensionManager` to
    load the extension before calling the check function so the plugin
    can be asked if it should be enabled.

0.5

  - Add :class:`~stevedore.tests.manager.TestExtensionManager` for
    writing tests for classes that use extension managers.

0.4

  - Removed the ``name`` argument to plugin constructors.
  - Added ``driver`` property to :class:`~stevedore.driver.DriverManager`.

0.3

  - Added dispatch managers for selecting among a set of plugins at
    runtime instead of load time.
  - Added ``__call__`` method to
    :class:`~stevedore.driver.DriverManager` so it can be invoked in a
    more natural fashion for a single plugin.

0.2

  - Added documentation

0.1
